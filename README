1. Introduction

masterserver is an attempt at writing a generic master server for
game servers, which register themselves to a master server.
masterserver is easily extendable via plugins written in C.

The name will most likely change, any suggestions welcome.

Beware: This is alpha quality. So it might crash 'n' burn.
Contributions and suggestions more than welcome.


2. Goals

- generic master server
- easy to extend via plugins
- output of server lists in XML
- document the network protocols of the supported games
- admin interface via console and tcp/ip
- more to come ...


4. Installation

Should be pretty straightforward.
Just execute "make" and it will compile.
To install execute "make install". (as root)
Now, you're ready to go.

You can start masterserver as any user. (preferably as a non privileged user)
masterserver has the ability to bind to a specific interface.
If you want to do that, you have to be root.
After masterserver has bound the sockets to the specific interface(s)
it drops the root privileges and sets its uid to "masterserver".
So you have to create a new user named "masterserver".

In the Makefile there are 2 other targets, named "masterserver" and "plugins", to either
only compile the masterserver or only the plugins.

There is no configuration file.
masterserver reads all files in the MASTERSERVER_LIB_DIR, which is defined
in masterserver.h and opens all files as shared objects.
(yes this isn't secure; this will change in the future)

Btw, to uninstall execute "make uninstall". (as root)


3. Misc

Thanks to:
iptables team and their source code from which I've learned how to use 
shared objects. <http://www.netfilter.org>

Ingo Rohlfs <irohlfs@irohlfs.de> for suggestions on the thread system and the
nightly debugging sessions.

Viktor Vasilev aka shr1k3 <shr1k3@gmx.at> for suggestions and code auditing.
