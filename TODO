Coming up next:
- docs: add details about destination of some packets
- rework lib{q2,h2} packet assembly code
- implement libq3 parser in lib{q2,h2} for player info etc.
- maybe rework the socket/interface binding code

Near future:
- static compile target in Makefile
  maybe dietlibc support
- implement some anti spamming/DoS or throttling system to prevent DoS attacks
- implement stub functions for protocols other than udp
- ascii version of docs/masterserver_thread_system.dia
- Signal handler
- specify as which user masterserver should run
- Damn UT is using TCP for communication with master server.
  Allow plugins to use protocols other than UDP for communication.
- autotools + FreeBSD support
- process packets in parallel

More or less far future:
- Support for other games:
	check tasks at http://sf.net/projects/lasange-system
- Stats
- admin commands/interface via network
- libq3: implement "getKeyAuthorize"
- libq3: implement player statistics(?)
- include a database interface in masterserver
