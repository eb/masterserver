Coming up next:
- plugin directory configurable (via command line option and with a hard coded default)
- code cleanup
- ascii version of docs/masterserver_thread_system.dia

Near future:
- Signal handler
- Heretic2 plugin
- specify as which user masterserver should run
- translate docs/PROTOKOLLE to english, clean it up and order it more clearly
  (maybe html or something like that)

More or less far future:
- Support for other games (HL, SoF, Q1, Q2, etc.)
	- UT2k3: http://unreal.student.utwente.nl/UT2003-queryspec.html
- Stats
- XML Output of server list
- admin commands/interface via network
- q3 plugin: honor getservers options (empty, full, demo, ffa, ...)
