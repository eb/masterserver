Coming up next:
- implement libq3 parser in lib{q2,h2} for player info etc.
- maybe rework the socket/interface binding code
- docs/PROTOCOLS: add stef1 packets
- H2 test suite
	- heartbeat/query/servers
	- ping/ack
	- heartbeat/query/servers/shutdown
- Q3 test suite
	- heartbeat/getservers/getserversResponse/2xheartbeat
- QW test suite
	- k/l
	- a/c/d
	- a/c/d/C
- D3 test suite
- EF test suite
- HexenWorld plugin
- more detailed packet description in docs/PROTOCOLS
  (e.g. when are the packets sent?, what is their purpose?)

Near future:
- implement some anti spamming/DoS or throttling system to prevent DoS attacks
- implement stub functions for protocols other than udp
- Damn UT is using TCP for communication with master server.
  Allow plugins to use protocols other than UDP for communication.
- process packets in parallel
- add more qw/q2/q3 based games
- docs/PROTOCOLS: check which options the stef1 master honors in getservers
- "The Sega.Net master server address is: "master.id-q3a.games.sega.net: 27950"
- check out the "populated=1" string gamespy3d sends to q2 master

More or less far future:
- Support for other games:
	check tasks at http://sf.net/projects/lasange-system
- Stats
- admin commands/interface via network
	- ability to load/unload plugins on-the-fly
- libq3: implement "getKeyAuthorize"
- libq3: implement player statistics(?)
- include a database interface in masterserver
  (the one from devil)
- Check RakNet Master source code
